# Human-Pose-Estimation-
# Human Pose Estimation with OpenCV and Streamlit

This project performs **human pose estimation** using OpenCV's deep learning module and TensorFlow pre-trained models. It provides a **Streamlit-based web application** that allows users to upload an image and detect human poses.

## Features
- Upload an image or use a demo image for pose estimation.
- Detect key body joints and connect them using predefined pose pairs.
- Adjust detection confidence threshold using a slider.
- Display the original and processed images with pose estimation.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy pillow streamlit
